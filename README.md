**My name is Shu Heng, a Y2 CS & Math student @ NUS**

My passion lies in applied and trustworthy AI, but I'm always on the lookout to learn more about how technology can help us solve problems.

In my free time I like swimming and sketching, I also am a sucker for the outdoors, where I'm often caught trying to climb a mountain during the summers :)
