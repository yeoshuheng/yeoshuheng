**My name is Shu Heng, a Y2 CS & Math student @ NUS.**

My passion lies in artificial intelligence (deep learning), but I'm always on the lookout to learn more about how technology can help us solve problems.

In my free time I like swimming and sketching, I'm also a sucker for the outdoors.

I also love research, where I'm currently interested in Robotics AI and making model inference more safe and efficient.

### Ongoing
