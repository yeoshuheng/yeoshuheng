**My name is Shu Heng, a Y1 CS & Math student @ NUS.**

My passion lies in artificial intelligence (deep learning), but I'm always on the lookout to learn more about how technology can help us solve problems.

In my free time I like swimming and sketching, I'm also a sucker for the outdoors.

### Ongoing
